## Arrays

- Data type // data structure (typeof array) -> object **special type of object**
- A collection...a list of elements - can be mixed.
  - strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects
- In JS we don't have to predetermine the size of the array
- Every element in the array has an index(location reference) that we can use to find where it is in the array.
  - JS arrays are a zero based index system

- Built in methods
  - Methods -- they need the `()` to execute.
  - `.push()`, `.pop()`
- Property
  - `.length`

## Loops

### For Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - Great for doing something a certain number of times
  - Great for iterating or looping through arrays!

```javascript
for(starting value; condition; increment){
  do something for a finite number of times
}
```

### While Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - While loops do something until the condition is false
  - Beware of infinite loops!

```javascript
while(condition){
  do soemthing until the condition is false
}
```
